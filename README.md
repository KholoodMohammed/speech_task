Convert Spoken Arabic Speech to Text Using  HTML,JavaScript and Css 

## Task1_speech

We have created a web page using HTML
In the body, we have added a button with written text and a microphone icon, and a text box in which the spoken text is written


## Script

We used JavaScript to create the Arabic-speaking function
Where the speaker speaks in Arabic after clicking on the microphone icon and it is in white during the speaking process and when it stops, it changes to black and ends, and the speaking function

**Note:** You must speak Arabic in order to activate the speaking function.

## Style(css)

I used CSS and it is used for the process of formatting the existing pages in terms of shape, display, color, and font
Where I changed the colors of the written text, the microphone icon and the button, and the way they were displayed in the middle of the page.
